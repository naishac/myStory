once upon a time a very hungry little boy was walking around a forest all alone. He could smell  pies being baked in the distance so he followed the scent and was led to a small cottage. When he entered the cottage he saw two pies on the table and began to drool. He looked around the cottage first but couldn't find anybody so he sat down at the table and devoured both the pies. As he was gobbling  his food,  the door opened and the owners of the small cottage entered the area. It was a small cat and a big dog. When the cat saw  the random little boy eating the food she cooked she screamed and the boy droppe the food out of shock. The big dog got mad very quickly and started to bark and the boy got scared and stumbled out of his chair. He ran as fast as he could as the dog chased behind him. He didn't look back once and only stopped when his little legs could no longer carry him any further. He panted and looked behind himself to see no big scary dog and sighed in relief, thankful that he was safe. He went back to his home and never made the same mistake again. The End.
